## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [# ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ #] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [# ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ #] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ #] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [# ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [# ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
 [I did not use any outside resources to help complete my submission]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Honestly, this whole project was a challenge. I'm not the best when it comes to coding but I don't let it stop me. This was the first project I completed outside of school and I am very proud that I was able to complete it. For everytime I thought "oh this is too hard", or " there's no way I can do this on my own" and even me thinking "I just wasn't smart enough", just because I don't have much experience in coding. However, I was able to put my doubts aside, and I kept pushing until I got the job done. That's how I overcame my doubts, by remebering why I am doing this in the first place. So that I can be apart of Codepath's Future Tech Launchpad Program. I knew the only way I'd have a chnace at this oppurtunity is if I completed my pre-work. My determination kept me going and I apply that same attitude to everything I do in life. I want to be better and I want to be successful and I feel like being apart of this program will be a stepping stone for my future career. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Some questions I have about web development are: Why isn’t there a way for the program to inform you about where or why the coding input is wrong? I felt like the coding process would be much easier for everyone if we knew what the exact problem of our code is instead of guessing what is right or wrong. Another question I have is how do web developers know exactly what to put in their code? Especially those developers that make huge apps like Facebook or snapchat? I’ve always wondered how they knew which function or tag to add in their program to make the apps run like they do now. My final question is why is the code in the program so easily affected? If I missed a comma the entire program doesn’t function. Why is that? And is there any way to avoid that?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a  few more hours to work on this project I would spend them looking for more hands on help. Having more hands on help is just better for everyone, it's an easier way to learn and you retain the information even better. Maybe I would've added a timer in my game to make it more exciting or maybe even some more buttons so that it could've been more challenging. However, I'm still pleased with what I did but I'm eagered to do even more. It was very exciting to create something like this game even though it's so simple.]
